These steps are mainly for Windows, while for Linux the steps are easier.

1) Install Pycharm, then activate with the educational package. You need to use the @student.utcluj.ro email and login here with sinu credentials. (https://intranet.utcluj.ro/login)

2) Install Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/)

3) Add python to Environment variables
Go to python27 folder
Take the path of the folder where python.exe is found and add it to your system path variable. In my case this path is (C:\Python27) 
Control panel->System and Security->System->Advanced system settings->Environment variables

4) We will create now a virtual environment for our laboratory
The virtual environment is verry usefull because will create an isolated python environment that will serve only for this lab.

4.1) Create a folder especially for this lab.
Download the PACMAN code from here: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cs188websitecontent/projects/release/search/v1/001/search.zip 
and unzip it in your new folder for the lab. It should be named generically "search".


4.2) Open a command line tab in this folder i.e. cmd 
You can simply click on the folder path and type cmd and then press enter. It will open automatically without navigation.

Type in cmd the following (> represents a command line)

> py -2 -m pip install virtualenv    
> py -2 -m virtualenv iai
>iai\Scripts\activate

# You should now see (iai) before the path

> python --version 
Python 2.7.17


4.3) Now from the same cmd, navigate in the search folder and run pacman.py by typing:

> python pacman.py


4.4) If you received a Tcl error that says something like:

"This probably means that Tcl wasn't installed properly."

Then do the following 4 steps and try again:

    Copy the folder tcl8.5 from C:/Python27/tcl
    Paste it to the C:/Python27/lib/ directory.
    Copy the folder tk8.5 from C:/Python27/tcl
    Paste it to the newly created C:/Python27/lib/tcl8.5 directory.

5)
Solve Exercise 1.1 from lab 
Solve Exercise 1.2 from lab

Run the examples in cmd and in PyCharm.
For PyCharm you pass parameters on the run in the following way:
From the PyCharm menu select Run-> Edit Configurations->Configuration->Parameters
Here in the Parameters tab, if you type on the cmd:
> python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p GoWestAgent
You will replace -l with --layout and -p with --pacman and type in the Parameters box:
--layout testMaze --pacman GoWestAgent

Done! Congrats!
